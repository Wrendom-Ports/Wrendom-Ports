I am a recent graduate, privacy and information security advocate, with a passion and dedication for solving complex problems.

## Objective


As a longtime privacy and security advocate, as well as a technology enthusiast and hobbyist, my journey has led me to pursue a career in Information Security, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst. These labs are meant to document my experience, the "Why", the process, and skills learned.
